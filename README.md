# Hourglass SCSS (WIP)

Hourglass is a bunch of CSS loaders I've been doing with SASS, based on the concept of heaving a single HTML only, with some simple class options, like:

``` html
<div class="loader"></div>
```

With some animations options based on the class added:

``` html
<div class="loader square-spin"></div>
```
